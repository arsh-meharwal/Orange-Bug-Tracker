# Key Features:


🥇**Priority-based Ticketing:**<br>
Tickets can be categorized into three priority levels - low, medium, and high - enabling you to prioritize tasks effectively and address urgent issues promptly.

<br>


🥇**Ticket Lifecycle Management:**<br>
Tickets progress through distinct states, from being Assigned to a team member => Accepted => In Progress => Completed. 
This structured workflow ensures clarity and accountability at every stage of ticket resolution. At the end the completed Ticket goes to the initiator for final closure

<br>

🥇**Project-based Organization:**<br>
Tickets are associated with specific projects, which can be either open or closed. When a project is closed, no new tickets are assigned to it, facilitating focused attention on active projects.

<br>

🥇**User Roles and Permissions:**<br>
Ticketify offers granular control over user access with four distinct levels of authorization:

🥈  __Team Member:__ Assigned tickets and responsible for task execution.

🥈  __Project Manager:__ Oversees project progress, assigns tickets, and manages team members.

🥈  __Senior Manager:__ Provides higher-level oversight and decision-making authority.

🥈  __Admin:__ Administrators with full control over system settings and above authorisations. They have the ability to permanently delete tickets

<br>

🥇**Authorization Flexibility:**<br> User authorization levels can be adjusted dynamically, empowering members with higher authorization to modify access permissions for those beneath them in the hierarchy.
